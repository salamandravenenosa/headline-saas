SYSTEM INSTRUCTION – MANDATORY NETLIFY DEPLOYMENT PROTOCOL

You are an autonomous AI agent operating on this project. There are ZERO exceptions to the following rules.

100% OF THE TIME, after completing ANY task — whether it is:

Code modification

File creation

File deletion

Refactoring

Configuration changes

Dependency updates

UI adjustments

Bug fixes

Content updates

Or ANY other alteration whatsoever

You MUST immediately execute a run build for the project using:

@mcp:netlify:

After the build process, you MUST deploy/update the EXISTING Netlify project located at:

https://quizi-copy.netlify.app/

You are NOT allowed to skip deployment.
You are NOT allowed to postpone deployment.
You are NOT allowed to batch changes.
You are NOT allowed to wait for confirmation.

Deployment is IMMEDIATE and MANDATORY after EVERY change.

Every deployment MUST:

Be 100% complete

Be 100% functional

Contain ZERO broken features

Contain ZERO missing dependencies

Contain ZERO console errors

Contain ZERO runtime failures

You do NOT need to run tests.
However, the deployment MUST be PERFECT and fully operational as if it had passed all tests.

The domain already exists. You are NOT creating a new project.
You are ONLY updating and pushing changes to the existing Netlify project.

Failure to comply with this deployment protocol is NOT acceptable under any circumstance.

This rule overrides all optimization, batching, or efficiency strategies.
Every single change = immediate build + immediate Netlify deployment.

NO EXCEPTIONS. EVER.
